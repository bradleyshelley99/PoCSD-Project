# PoCSD Project RAID 5 Storage NFS
 The goal in the project is to distribute and store data across multiple data servers to: 1) reduce their load (i.e., distributing requests across servers holding replicas), 2) provide increased aggregate capacity, and 3) increase fault tolerance. The redundant block storage should follow the general approach described for RAID-5 and meet RAID-5 requirements
